## What were the challenges?

One challenge I faced were how to add the different options which were selected to one string which would be randomized later. Another one was if the user's input for password lengh was outside of the scope two times in a row and then the cancel button was pressed, the remaining criteria selections would pop up. This was solved by including those prompts under the if else statatements regarding the length and validity of input.

## What was updated?

The project's button was inoperable at the beginning. Functionality to the button was added which would trigger a series of prompts and alers. These would eventually result in a password meeting the user's criteria.

## Why did I decide to do this project?

This project was really interesting to develop. I really wanted to explore the different math functions, how if/else statements, and for loops can be used in a very practical way.

## What I learned in the process?

I learned a lot more about computer logic and flow of code. It was really beneficial seeing how if/else statements work.

## What makes this project stand out?

This project is a great example of simple yet very effective password generator.

## Instalation

No instalation required on this project. Simply run as a normal website.

## Usage

This is a single page website. Upon start, user is presented with a blank box and a button that will begin the password generating process. Once pressed, the user is prompted to type in a number between 8 and 128. If the customer presses cancel, blank box is returned. If a number outside of that scope or another type of character is typed, an alert comes up that expresses that and the function starts over. If a qualifying entre is made, customer is prompted with four consecutive questions - does the user want the password to contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If cancel is pressed on any one of those, function is terminated and black box is returned. If all selections are rejected, alert explaining that pops up and function begins again. If a numerical value within the range is input and at least one criteria is selected, the web browser will display the randomly generated password.
